To run the program, the main.py must be started via a development environment or the console with the command (python main.py). 
A prerequisite for the runability of the individual modules is that the graph database in Neo4J is started and thus accessible. 
Neo4J can be obtained from https://neo4j.com/download/. In the context of this work the Neo4J Desktop version for Windows was used. 
The graph database can be created manually via the csv import sequence or via the .dump file from the "Neo4J folder".
